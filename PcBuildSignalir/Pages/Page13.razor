<p>The loop connections from the pump to the graphics card were tuff, had to do a full 360 degree loop to prevent kinks, rest of the loop is okay. Hard pipping would of looked much better but makes working on the pc afterwards a real pain.</p>

<p>How bright is this! I will be turning the rgb off later, can't be gaming wearing sunglasses.</p>
