<p>Now on to the the graphics card, cooling this as well so need to dismantle it, fiddly.</p>
<p>Top cover removed everthing else as its is originally. All I need is the circuit board, so all cooling must go.</p>

<p>At the bottom right of the circuit board is a very small connection, this took 30 minutes to unplug. Watched several how to videos they all just say undo the three connections (other two were easy) but this one was a pain. All it controls is the lighting, since I am removing that I was very tempted to just cut it, but eventually managed it.</p>
